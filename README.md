# vue_weatherApp
Vue.JS Weather App powered by Open Weather Map API

This is a qucik weather app. that I built using OpenWeather Api:

To start: 
Type in location (if in US it will defualt to US)
  if> temp is above 65 that back ground will change to a warmer picture
  if> temp is below 65 it will stay a cooler background
  
  If you are for ex: trying to look for somewhere in the UK type..ex: london, UK
  ex: if you are looking ex: Rome, Italy (if you type in rome it will auto populate Rome US) you need to type Rome, IT and that will populate Rome Italy
